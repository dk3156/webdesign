                                    The title track 'WANNABE' is the most accurate representation of the overall style of the album. We emphasized the meaning, 'I want to be me, and I'm precious as I am. ' I'll truly be proud if many people listen to this album and think, 'ITZY has grown even more. '”

                                    "I wrote this song when I was young. I think I was maybe nineteen or twenty. I think writers often find themselves wondering if their subject matter is too generic. When I first started writing, I too remember considering “generality” an enemy. 

                                    Now that I’ve grown to be more honest with myself, I’m able to openly admit that most of my favorite songs are usually the more simple ones. Yes, the ones with cliche-pop chord progressions that sing about the same-old “lover stuff”. Still, I find some songs, seemingly without anything novel, still manage to really ring something in your heart. Like a lot of Bob Dylan stuff.
                                    
                                    I think writing a song is like letting another person know how you feel. Sometimes it will comes across; sometimes it won’t. And as there are things that separate the shitty relationships from the ones that will be written in you for eternity, there’s also something that sets apart the mundane songs from the ones that really come to hold a place inside us. 
                                    
                                    And whatever that difference maybe, all we can do on our part is to pour in our hearts.  I think that was the feeling I was trying to capture when I wrote this one.
                                    
                                    So, in a way, while this song is a “love song”, it’s also a “song about love songs”. A Korean Independent Rock Band's music video.
